//Some people are standing in a row in a park.
// There are trees between them which cannot be moved.
// Your task is to rearrange the people by their heights in a non-descending order without moving the trees. People can be very tall!

CODE:

function solution(a) {
  const heights = a.filter((value) => value !== -1);
  heights.sort((a, b) => a - b);

  let index = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
    if (a[i] !== -1) {
      a[i] = heights[index];
      index++;
    }
  }

  return a;
}
