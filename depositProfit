// You have deposited a specific amount of money into your bank account.
// Each year your balance increases at the same growth rate. With the assumption that you don't make any additional deposits,
// find out how long it would take for your balance to pass a specific threshold.

CODE:

function solution(deposit, rate, threshold) {
  let years = 0;
  while (deposit < threshold) {
    deposit += (deposit * rate) / 100;
    years++;
  }
  return years;
}
