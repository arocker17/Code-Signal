// You are given an array of integers representing coordinates of obstacles situated on a straight line.
// Assume that you are jumping from the point with coordinate 0 to the right. You are allowed only to make jumps of the same length represented by some integer.
// Find the minimal length of the jump enough to avoid all the obstacles.

CODE:

unction solution(inputArray) {
  const maxObstacle = Math.max(...inputArray);

  let jumpLength = 1;
  while (true) {
    let obstacleAvoided = true;
    for (let i = 0; i < inputArray.length; i++) {
      if (inputArray[i] % jumpLength === 0) {
        obstacleAvoided = false;
        break;
      }
    }

    if (obstacleAvoided) {
      return jumpLength;
    }

    jumpLength++;
  }
}
