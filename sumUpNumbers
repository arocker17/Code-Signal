// CodeMaster has just returned from shopping. He scanned the check of the items he bought and gave the resulting string to
// Ratiorg to figure out the total number of purchased items. Since Ratiorg is a bot he is definitely going to automate it,
// so he needs a program that sums up all the numbers which appear in the given input.
// Help Ratiorg by writing a function that returns the sum of numbers that appear in the given inputString.

CODE:

function solution(inputString) {
    const numbers = inputString.match(/\d+/g);
    let sum =0;
    
    if (numbers) {
        for (const number of numbers) {
            sum += parseInt(number, 10);
        }
    }
    
    return sum;
}
