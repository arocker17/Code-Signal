// Last night you partied a little too hard. Now there's a black and white photo of you that's about to go viral!
// You can't let this ruin your reputation, so you want to apply the "box blur" algorithm to the photo to hide its content. ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_blur )
// The pixels in the input image are represented as integers. The algorithm distorts the input image in the following way:
// Every pixel x in the output image has a value equal to the average value of the pixel values from the 3 Ã— 3 square
// that has its center at x, including x itself. All the pixels on the border of x are then removed. Return the blurred image as an integer, with the fractions rounded down.

CODE:

function solution(image) {
  const numRows = image.length;
  const numCols = image[0].length;

  const blurredImage = new Array(numRows - 2);
  for (let i = 0; i < numRows - 2; i++) {
    blurredImage[i] = new Array(numCols - 2);
  }

  for (let i = 1; i < numRows - 1; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j < numCols - 1; j++) {
      let sum = 0;
      let count = 0;

      for (let r = i - 1; r <= i + 1; r++) {
        for (let c = j - 1; c <= j + 1; c++) {
          sum += image[r][c];
          count++;
        }
      }

      blurredImage[i - 1][j - 1] = Math.floor(sum / count);
    }
  }

  return blurredImage;
}
