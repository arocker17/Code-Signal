// JavaScript code
// Ratiorg got statues of different sizes as a present from CodeMaster for his birthday,
// each statue having an non-negative integer size. Since he likes to make things perfect,
// he wants to arrange them from smallest to largest so that each statue will be bigger than the previous one exactly by 1.
// He may need some additional statues to be able to accomplish that. Help him figure out the minimum number of additional statues needed.

CODE:

function solution(statues) {
  statues.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  let additionalStatues = 0;

  for (let i = 1; i < statues.length; i++) {
    if (statues[i] - statues[i - 1] !== 1) {
      additionalStatues += statues[i] - statues[i - 1] - 1;
    }
  }

  return additionalStatues;
}
