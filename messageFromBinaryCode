// You are taking part in an Escape Room challenge designed specifically for programmers. In your efforts to find a clue,
// you've found a binary code written on the wall behind a vase, and realized that it must be an encrypted message.
// After some thought, your first guess is that each consecutive 8 bits of the code stand for the character with the corresponding extended ASCII code ( https://www.ascii-code.com/ ).
// Assuming that your hunch is correct, decode the message.

CODE:

function solution(code) {
    let decodedMessage = '';
    
    for (let i = 0; i < code.length; i += 8) {
        const binaryChar = code.substr(i, 8);
        const decimalChar = parseInt(binaryChar, 2);
        const asciiChar = String.fromCharCode(decimalChar);
        decodedMessage += asciiChar;
    }
    
    return decodedMessage;
}
