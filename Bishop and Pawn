// Given the positions of a white bishop and a black pawn on the standard chess board, determine whether the bishop can capture the pawn in one move.
// The bishop has no restrictions in distance for each move, but is limited to diagonal movement.

CODE:

function solution(bishop, pawn) {
  const bishopX = bishop.charCodeAt(0) - 96; 
  const bishopY = parseInt(bishop[1]); 

  const pawnX = pawn.charCodeAt(0) - 96; 
  const pawnY = parseInt(pawn[1]); 

  if (Math.abs(bishopX - pawnX) === Math.abs(bishopY - pawnY)) {
    return true;
  }

  return false;
}
